1st Semester Project in which I used Python 3.x to create a website containing tutorials on programming. Django has not been. It has some elements of OOP involved in populating the webpage containing tutorials but it mainly focuses on HTML and Bootstrap.

The Theme for website is available here: https://startbootstrap.com/themes/creative/
